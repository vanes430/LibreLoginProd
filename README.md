# Maintenance update 🚀 ❗❗❗minecraft 1.21+

update: Thanks to vuxeim and his contribution we can still use LibreLoginProd with the newest minecraft versions.

After couple of weeks I've decided to make a move towards new login plugin which is currently under development.
I'm not going to maintain this plugin anymore, but still I'm open to PR's.
Here's the new plugin repo: https://github.com/Navio1430/NavAuth. I'm open to literally any support (even by leaving a star) with code, docs, ideas etc. also anything from todo's list.

 <h1>LibreLoginProd 🔐 - autologin plugin</h1>
  <p>Fork of the <b>LibreLogin</b> (previously LibrePremium) which has caused many problems with newest minecraft versions.
LibreLogin did not meet our expectations, which is why this fork was created.</p>

# FAQ

### What does prod mean?
This means that the project is a heavily modified version intended for production use.

### Why is the plugin almost 5MB?
We are currently trying to go down to 500KB, but first we need
to divide whole project into submodules.

### Will the folder name change after installation?
No, we use the same folder and config names as original the **LibreLogin**.
