# IMPORTANT NOTICE 🚀 ❗

**New Feature: Seamless Proxy-Side Dialog Authentication (Velocity Only)**
- **Zero-Limbo Auth:** Players on **MC 1.21.6+** now authenticate using a modern Pop-up Dialog UI directly at the Proxy level.
- **Improved Performance:** No more forced server switching to Limbo for modern clients; authentication happens during the "Joining World" phase.
- **Fully Configurable:** All dialog texts, titles, and buttons can be customized in `messages.conf`.
- **Enhanced Stability:** Legacy reflection-based Floodgate detection has been replaced with a stable PacketEvents implementation.

# Maintenance update 🚀 ❗

update: Thanks to vuxeim and his contribution we can still use LibreLoginProd with the newest minecraft versions.

I'm not going to maintain this plugin anymore, but still I'm open to PR's.
Here's the new plugin repo: https://github.com/Navio1430/NavAuth.

 <h1>LibreLoginProd 🔐 - autologin plugin</h1>
  <p>Fork of the <b>LibreLogin</b> (previously LibrePremium) which has caused many problems with newest minecraft versions.
LibreLogin did not meet our expectations, which is why this fork was created.</p>

# FAQ

### What does prod mean?
This means that the project is a heavily modified version intended for production use.

### Why is the plugin almost 5MB?
We are currently trying to go down to 500KB, but first we need
to divide whole project into submodules.

### Will the folder name change after installation?
No, we use the same folder and config names as original the **LibreLogin**.
